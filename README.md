In this challenge, we scrape additional content for the web app. We focused on adding more images to the app. to do these steps we used 
- Use BeautifulSoup and Splinter to automate a web browser and scrape high-resolution images.
- Use a MongoDB database to store data from the web scrape.
- Update the web application and Flask to display the data from the web scrape.
- Use Bootstrap to style the web app.


We visited the Mars Hemispheres and used DevTools to find the proper elements to scrape.To complete this task, we obatined high-resolution images for each of Marâ€™s hemispheres, access the full resolution, saved both url string and hemispehere, used phython dictionary and append the dictonary image URL.
